<br />

I am a Data Scientist. Prior to this role, I worked as a Research Assistant, specializing in data analysis during my undergraduate studies. I completed my bachelor's degree in Economics and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at the Institute of Computing, UFAL. I am always striving to enhance my skills and knowledge.

My expertise is centered around the practical application of continuous/combinatorial optimization techniques, statistical methods, econometrics, machine learning techniques (Regression, Classification, Clustering, dimensionality reduction), and NLP to solve challenging problems in various business domains.

In a professional context, I have a business-oriented approach and a generalist profile. This allows me to handle various stages of the analytical process, from descriptive and diagnostic analysis to predictive and prescriptive modeling. Through this comprehensive approach, I aim to gain meaningful insights from data by identifying patterns, trends, and opportunities.
